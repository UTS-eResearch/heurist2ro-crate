In 1930 his farm and livestock was offered for sale. in 1935, the Roseworthy magazine reported he was residing in Naracoorte. In 1938 the Student magazine reported he had a property in Naracoorte. His farming activities were disrupted in 1940 when he enlisted to serve in the army. His farm and animals were offered up to sale in 1940. Post WWII, he probably resumed sheep raising, there was newspaper advertisement of merino wool for sale from his farm at Naracoorte.",
